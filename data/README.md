# Where to get the data?

Most data can be directly downloaded using a script provided in the code directory. The following two datasets need to be downloaded manually from Adaptive's data access portal:

Lindau et al. J Immunol 2017: https://doi.org/10.21417/PL2018JI
-> Select all PBMC samples and download
-> Export view to obtain the raw metadata
-> We produced a cleaned metadata file by hand

Chu et al. BMC Immunology 2019: https://doi.org/10.21417/B7J01X
-> Select all PBMC/Memory/Naive samples and download
