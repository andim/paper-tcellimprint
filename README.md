It allows reproduction of the statistical analyses and numerical results reported in the manuscript.

For a number of figures final assembly and cosmetic changes were done in inkscape as a postprocessing step. In these cases the figures will not be reproduced precisely. To help reuse the final edited figures are provided in png/svg format.

## Installation requirements

The code uses Python 3.6+.

A number of standard scientific python packages are needed for the numerical simulations and visualizations. An easy way to install all of these is to install a Python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
